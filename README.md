# BlockOutliner
Outlines Minecraft blocks to be used in https://texturerotationai.netlify.app
Make sure the image you want to outline is in the same repostiory as the python script.
Crop out the chat, hotbar, player's hand, and any other blocks like the sky and gravel that don't have texture rotations. 

You also have to install opencv and numpy (together they make a great team)
```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
